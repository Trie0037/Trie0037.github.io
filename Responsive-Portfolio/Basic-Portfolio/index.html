            I was born and raised in Minnesota. I studied at St. Cloud State University and the University of Minnesota. I also
            studied abroad in England for a semester and have traveled to Europe three times since. I've managed GNC and
            the Vitamin Shoppe for nearly 15 years. Since I turned 40 last summer, I've wondered to myself, 'What's next'?
            That question has ultimately led me here to the U of MN Bootcamp !
